# Palindrom

## Definition
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards such as 'madam' or 'racecar', the date '12/11/21', and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".The 19-letter Finnish word 'saippuakivikauppias' (a soapstone vendor), is the longest single-word palindrome in everyday use, while the 12-letter term tattarrattat (from James Joyce in Ulysses) is the longest in English. Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored - Wikipedia

Others examples include 'kayak', 'sos', '1991'.

## Functional Analysis
